# Fullist - BrainStation Capstone

![Fullist logo](./src/assets/logos/logo-filled.png)

An application for finding the closest supermarket that has everything you need!

## Project Description

This application was created for the final Capstone project during my BrainStation web development bootcamp, with the inital version being created in under two weeks.

### The Problem

The problem I was looking to solve was that often I might go to the supermarket with a long list of items, and when I get there I realise the shop does not have everything I want, which leads to a second trip to another shop and considerable frustration ðŸ˜–

### The Solution

Fullist aims to solve this problem by way of an application that the user can enter in their full shopping list. Then along with the given location, a list of nearest shops is returned letting the user know which locations have their full list in stock ðŸ›’

### Technologies

For this project I created a full-stack application with React for the client and Express for the server. Along with that I used the following npm packages:

- sass
- axios
- mapbox-gl
- swiper
- animate.css
- react-toastify
- mui

### Future Additions

Going forward I would like to add:

- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Create a React Native version
- Improve accessiilty by way of ARIA labels and ensuring all colours are colour-blind appropriate
- Deploy using Heroku
- Add autocomplete for user-added items, using the Spoonacular API
- Add pages for recipes
- Add user profiles to save individual lists
- Create a database for storing all data securely
- And so much more... ðŸš€

## Instructions for running

2. Input `npm i` into the console to download all required npm packages
3. Create a .env file using the .env.example file as a template
4. Input `npm start` into the console to initate the client
5. Enjoy finding where you can get your full list! ðŸ¥³
